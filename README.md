# Titanic Survival Prediction

## About

This repository contains a logistic regression project focused on predicting the likelihood of a passenger's survival on the Titanic. The project utilizes a dataset comprising various features such as age, gender, ticket class, and more to train a logistic regression model. The primary objective is to explore the factors influencing survival rates among Titanic passengers and build a predictive model.

## Brief Description

The sinking of the Titanic in 1912 was a tragic event that claimed the lives of many passengers. This project aims to analyze and predict the survival outcomes of individuals based on different attributes. The dataset includes information about passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, and whether they had family members aboard.

### Key Steps:

1. **Data Exploration:** Investigate the dataset to understand its structure and identify patterns or trends.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values and ensure compatibility with the logistic regression model.
3. **Feature Selection:** Identify significant features that contribute to the prediction of survival.
4. **Model Training:** Utilize logistic regression to train the predictive model on the training dataset.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Assess the performance of the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix.
6. **Prediction:** Apply the trained model to new data to predict whether a passenger survived or not.
7. **Visualization:** Create visualizations to illustrate key insights and trends in the data.

This project serves as a practical application of logistic regression for binary classification tasks, providing valuable insights into the factors that influenced the survival of passengers on the Titanic.
